# ðŸ‘® Permissions Per Role

Never fear about the gameplay. Default players have the ability to use and access the majority of the server. The paid roles only allow a little more flexibility.&#x20;

![](.gitbook/assets/vip.png)Donator Ranks allow more flexibility through some of the plugins.

![](.gitbook/assets/vipplus.png)Donator+ Ranks have unrestricted access and even bypass our server anticheat.&#x20;

Please check out the Permission Pages below to see what you're fully allowed access to. If you're interested in buying a higher rank, do /buy in game to get started. You can also goto [https://poa.buycraft.net/](https://poa.buycraft.net) .&#x20;
