## The POA Experience

POA is a Modded Multiverse Server.\
Using special plugins, this server has a slight modded feel. With the ability to add heads, poseable armor stands, and other craftables. Elite Mobs are also here to make things a bit harder. Keeping it easy to navigate, our Spawn features fast portals to Nether, End, and Hub regions.

&#x20;So what are you waiting for? Come on in and start your journey.

## Hacking Allowed

Our server keeps it minimal when it comes to the plugins we use. However, keeping the experience level for everyone is our main goal. Special plugins are used to help us achieve this.

## PVP

No limitations on player interaction. Hunt them down or just sit at spawn and wait for the kills to come to you. With our Player Head Drops, you'll be able to show off your kills!

Want to restrict it down some and make it purely skill and armor? Check out the PVP Arena!  Access it by "/mvtp world\_pvp" or heading to the portal found at the Hub "/hub"

## Build and explore

More to explore and always close to spawn with our "/spawn" system. FilteredHoppers makes it even easier to filter out items without the lengthy Redstone.&#x20;
