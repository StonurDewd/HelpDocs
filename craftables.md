With the Magic Hopper Thing, you can click on hoppers and set a filter! No more lengthy redstone! You can choose to turn the filter on, off, whitelist, blacklist. Even have it set to exact match.

You just have to place an empty shulker box, a book, and then whatever item\(s\) you want it to auto collect - It's that simple.
